TODO:

add post die() win/lose screen, send player to end of file
i'm not exactly sure why, but difficulty doesnt seem to be getting set properly.
maybe more skins/ extra modifiers?
make music loop
change size of explosion
make AI's captures also explode
sound effects??


BUGS TO FIX:

ANALYS kings are not affected by die()
