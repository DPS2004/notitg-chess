TODO:

add post die() win/lose screen, send player to end of file
i'm not exactly sure why, but difficulty doesnt seem to be getting set properly.
maybe more skins/ extra modifiers?
make music loop
change size of explosion
make AI's captures also explode
let player play as black, probably through an extra modifier accessed via down key
sound effects??


BUGS TO FIX:

Fix player ease visual bug
make glowy spot behavior more consistant, especially post-player move and post-die()
ANALYS kings are not affected by die()
